# CurrentWeatherWebPage

Create a mobile website with any topic that you like. Have at least one html page and css for styling including media query for mobile view. Create a branch and optionally give someone else in the classroom access to it

This will be the beginning of my final project. I hope to have a functioning weather app that I will be able to migrate to my phone and use to check a myriad of things. I want to build it out to show snow reports, swell cycles, follow storms. I will have to purchase the API but I hope to have something running by the end of the year.
